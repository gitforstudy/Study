Block-Ack:
==========

The Block Ack mechanism improves channel efficiency by aggregating several acknowledgments into one frame. There are two types of Block Ack mechanisms, immediate and delayed. Immediate Block Ack is suitable for high-bandwidth, low-latency traffic while the delayed Block Ack is suitable for applications that tolerate moderate latency.

The Block Ack mechanism is initialized by an exchange of ADDBA Request/Response frames. After initialization, blocks of QoS data frames may be transmitted from the originator to the recipient. A block may be started within a polled TXOP or by winning EDCA contention. The MPDUs within the block of frames are acknowledged by a BlockAck frame, which is requested by a BlockAckReq frame.

Setup
 - Tx STA (originator) first check whether the intended recipient STA is capable of participating in BlockAck mechanism by discovering and examining 
   its Delayed Block Ack and Immediate Block Ack capability bits. If the intended recipient STA is capable of participating, the originator sends an 
   ADDBA Request frame indicating the TID for which the Block Ack is being set up.
 - The recipient STA shall respond by an ADDBA Response frame. The recipient STA has the option of accepting or rejecting the request. When the 
   recipient STA accepts, then a Block Ack agreement exists between the originator and recipient.

Data & BlockAck
 - Originator may transmit a block of QoS data frames separated by SIFS period, with the total number of frames not exceeding the Buffer Size subfield 
   value in the associated ADDBA Response frame and subject to any additional duration limitations based on the channel access mechanism. Each of the 
   frames shall have the Ack Policy subfield in the QoS Control field set to Block Ack.
 - The originator requests acknowledgment of outstanding QoS data frames by sending a Basic BlockAckReq frame. The recipient shall maintain a Block 
   Ack record for the block.  

Teardown
 - When the originator has no data to send and the final Block Ack exchange has completed, it shall signal the end of its use of the Block Ack 
   mechanism by sending the DELBA frame to its recipient. There is no management response frame from the recipient. The recipient of the DELBA frame  
   shall release all resources allocated for the Block Ack transfer.
 - The Block Ack agreement may be torn down if there are no BlockAck, BlockAckReq, or QoS data frames (sent under Block Ack policy) for the Block 
   Ack’s TID received from the peer within a duration of Block Ack timeout value.

   represented

Octets:             2          					128
			BA Information field (Basic BlockAck)

 - The Block Ack Bitmap subfield is 128 octets in length and is used to indicate the received status of up to 64 MSDUs. 
 - Bit position n of the Block Ack bitmap, if equal to 1, acknowledges receipt of an MPDU with an MPDU sequence control value equal to (Block Ack 
   Starting Sequence Control + n).
 - Bit position n of the Block Ack bitmap, if equal to 0, indicates that an MPDU with MPDU sequence control value equal to (Block Ack Starting 
   Sequence Control + n) has not been received.
 - Each of the MPDU Sequence Control field and Block Ack Starting Sequence Control subfield values are treated as a 16-bit unsigned integer. For
   unused fragment numbers of an MSDU, the corresponding bits in the bitmap are set to 0.

 - The Block Ack Bitmap subfield of the BA Information field of the Compressed BlockAck frame is 8 octets in length and is used to indicate the 
   received status of up to 64 MSDUs and A-MSDUs.
 - Each bit that is equal to 1 in the compressed Block Ack bitmap acknowledges the successful reception of a single MSDU or A-MSDU in the order of 
   sequence number, with the first bit of the Block Ack bitmap corresponding to the MSDU or A-MSDU with the sequence number that matches the value of 
   the Starting Sequence Number subfield of the Block Ack Starting Sequence Control subfield.

Multi-TID BlockAck variant:
---------------------------
 - The TID_INFO subfield of the BA Control field of the Multi-TID BlockAck frame contains the number of TIDs, less one, for which information is 
   reported in the BA Information field. For example, a value of 2 in the TID_INFO subfield means that information for three TIDs is present.
 - The BA Information field of the Multi-TID BlockAck frame comprises 1 or more instances of the Per TID Info, Block Ack Starting Sequence Control, 
   and the Block Ack Bitmap subfields.
 - The Starting Sequence Number subfield of the Block Ack Starting Sequence Control subfield is the sequence number of the first MSDU or A-MSDU for    
   which this BlockAck frame is sent.
 - The Fragment Number subfield of the Block Ack Starting Sequence Control subfield is set to 0. The first instance of the Per TID Info, Block Ack 
   Starting Sequence Control, and Block Ack Bitmap subfields that is transmitted corresponds to the lowest TID value, with subsequent instances
   ordered by increasing values of the Per TID Info subfield.

 - The A-MSDU Supported subfield determines whether an A-MSDU may be carried in a QoS data MPDU sent under this Block Ack agreement. When equal to 1, 
   use of A-MSDU is permitted. When equal to 0, use of A-MSDU is not permitted.
 - The Block Ack Policy subfield is set to 1 for immediate Block Ack and 0 for delayed Block Ack.
 - The TID subfield contains the value of the TC or TS for which the BlockAck is being requested.
 - The Buffer Size subfield indicates the number of buffers available for this particular TID. 21 When the A-MSDU Supported field is equal to 0 as 
   indicated by the STA transmitting the Block Ack Parameter Set field, each buffer is capable of holding a number of octets equal to the maximum size 
   of an MSDU. When the A-MSDU Supported field is equal to 1 as indicated by the STA, each buffer is capable of holding a number of octets equal to 
   the maximum size of an A-MSDU that is supported by the STA.
 - In an ADDBA Request frame, the Buffer Size subfield is intended to provide guidance for the frame receiver to decide its reordering buffer size and 
   is advisory only. If the Buffer Size subfield is equal to 0, it implies that the originator of the Block Ack has no information to specify its
   value.
 - In an ADDBA Response frame, when the Status Code field is equal to 0, the Buffer Size subfield is set to a value of at least 1.

Block Ack Timeout Value field:
------------------------------
 - The Block Ack Timeout Value field is used in the ADDBA Request and Response frames to indicate the timeout value for Block Ack. The length of the 
   Block Ack Timeout Value field is 2 octets.

 - The Block Ack Timeout Value field contains the duration, in TUs, after which the Block Ack setup is terminated, if there are no frame exchanges
   within this duration using this Block Ack agreement. A value of 0 disables the timeout.

   octets.

 - The Initiator subfield indicates if the originator or the recipient of the data is sending this frame. It is set to 1 to indicate the originator 
   and is set to 0 to indicate the recipient. The TID subfield indicates the TSID or the UP for which the Block Ack has been originally set up.
   
Block Ack Action frame details:
-------------------------------
 - The ADDBA frames are used to set up or, if PBAC is used, to modify Block Ack for a specific TC or TS. A Block Ack Action field, in the octet 
   immediately after the Category field, differentiates the Block Ack Action frame formats.
 - The Block Ack Action field values associated with each frame format within the Block Ack category are

			1								ADDBA Response
			2 								DELBA
			3–255 							Reserved
