--> Connection Procedure & Frame exchange:
==========================================

Access points are bridges that bridge traffic between mobile stations and other devices on the network. 
Before a mobile station can send traffic through an AP, it must be in the appropriate connection state.
 
The three 802.11 connection states are:
    Not authenticated or associated.
    Authenticated but not yet associated.
    Authenticated and associated. 

A mobile station must be in an authenticated and associated state before bridging will occur.
The mobile station and AP will exchange a series of 802.11 management frames in order to get to an authenticated and associated state.

A mobile station starts out as not authenticated and associated.
 
1. A mobile station sends probe requests to discover 802.11 networks within its proximity. Probe requests advertise the mobile stations 
   supported data rates and 802.11 capabilities such as 802.11n. Because the probe request is sent from the mobile station to the destination layer-2 
   address and BSSID of ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff all AP's that receive it will respond.
 
2. APs receiving the probe request check to see if the mobile station has at least one common supported data rate. If they have compatible data rates,
   a probe response is sent advertising the SSID (wireless network name), supported data rates, encryption types if required, and other 802.11 
   capabilities of the AP. 
   A mobile station chooses compatible networks from the probe responses it receives. Compatibility could be based on encryption type. 
   Once compatible networks are discovered the mobile station will attempt low-level 802.11 authentication with compatible APs.
   Keep in mind that 802.11 authentication is not the same as WPA2 or 802.1X authentication mechanisms which occur after a mobile station is 
   authenticated and associated. Originally 802.11 authentication frames were designed for WEP encryption however this security scheme has been 
   proven to be insecure and therefore deprecated. Because of this 802.11 authentication frames are open and almost always succeed.

3. A mobile station sends a low-level 802.11 authentication frame to an AP setting the authentication to open and the sequence to 0x0001.
 
4. The AP receives the authentication frame and responds to the mobile station with authentication frame set to open indicating a sequence of 0x0002.
   If an AP receives any frame other than an authentication or probe request from a mobile station that is not authenticated it will respond with a 
   deauthentication frame placing the mobile into an unauthenticated an unassociated state. The station will have to begin the association process 
   from the low level authentication step. At this point the mobile station is authenticated but not yet associated. Some 802.11 capabilities allow
   a mobile station to low-level authenticate to multiple APs. This speeds up the association process when moving between APs. A mobile station can 
   be 802.11 authenticated to multiple APs however it can only be actively associated and transferring data through a single AP at a time.  

5. Once a mobile station determines which AP it would like to associate to, it will send an association request to that AP. The association request 
   contains chosen encryption types if required and other compatible 802.11 capabilities. 
   If an AP receives a frame from a mobile station that is authenticated but not yet associated, it will respond with a disassociation frame placing 
   the mobile into an authenticated but unassociated state. 

6. If the elements in the association request match the capabilties of the AP, the AP will create an Association ID for the mobile station and 
   respond with an association response with a success message granting network access to the mobile station.  

7. Now the mobile station is successfully associated to the AP and data transfer can begin.
 
Note: If WPA/WPA2 or 802.1X authentication is required on the wireless network, the mobile station will not be able to send data until dynamic 
      keying and authentication have taken place after the 802.11 Association is complete.

--> 4-way handshake :
=====================
The 4-way handshake is the process of exchanging 4 messages between an access point (authenticator) and the client device (supplicant) to generate some encryption keys which can be used to encrypt actual data sent over Wireless medium. These keys which are generated through 4-way handshake are generated by some source key material.
The 4-Way Handshake uses four EAPOL-Key frame messages between the
    authenticator and the supplicant for six major purposes:
       - Confirm the existence of the PMK at the peer station.
       - Ensure that the PMK is current.
       - Derive a new pairwise transient key from the PMK.
       - Install the PTK on the supplicant and the authenticator.
       - Transfer the GTK from the authenticator to the supplicant and install
         the GTK on the supplicant and, if necessary, the authenticator.
       - Confirm the selection of the cipher suites
    There are some key terminology which is using in 4 way handshake i.e:
       - MSK-Master Session Key ( or AAA Key):
         Key information that is jointly negotiated between the Supplicant &
         Authentication Server. This key information is transported via a
         secure channel from Authenticating Server to Authenticator.
       - PMK-Pairwise Master Key:
         PMK is derived from MSK seeding material. PMK is first 256bits
         (0-255) of MSK. It can be derived from an EAP method or directly
         from a PresharedKey(PSK).
       - GMK-Group Master Key:
         GMK is randomly created on Authenticator & refresh it in configured
         time interval to reduce the risk of GMK being compromised.
       - PTK-Pairwise Transient Key:
         A value derived from PMK, Authenticator nonce(Anonce), Supplicant
         nonce(Snonce), Authenticator Address, Supplicant Address. This is
         used to encrypt all unicast transmission between client & an AP.
         The client and access point will derive their own separate pairwise
         transient key (PTK). The PTK is derived from each device’s pairwise
         master key (PMK).
         PTK = PRF (PMK + Anonce + SNonce + Mac (AA)+ Mac (SA))
         PTK consist of 5 different keys:
         1. KCK (Key Confirmation Key): used to provide data integrity during
            4 -Way Handshake & Group Key Handshake.
         2. KEK (Key Encryption Key): used by EAPOL-Key frames to provide data
            privacy during 4-Way Handshake & Group Key Handshake.
         3. Temporal Key: used to encrypt & decrypt MSDU of 802.11 data
            frames between supplicant & authenticator
         4. Temporal MIC-1
         5. Temporal MIC-2
       - GTK-Group Temporal Key:
         GTK is used to encrypt all broadcast/multicast transmission between
         an AP & multiple client stations. GTK is derived on Authenticator &
         sending to supplicant during 4-Way Handshake (M3)

In case of 802.1X/EAP authentication, when the access point sends an EAP-Success frame and the AP can now initiate the 4-Way Handshake. Keep in mind that the authentication process has already generated the master keys (PMK and GMK), which will be used by the 4-Way Handshake to derive the temporal keys. In case of WPA2-psk 4 way handshake starts immediately after Open System Authentication & Association state finish.

 4-way handshake frame exchange:
       - M1: The authenticator and supplicant each randomly create their
         respective nonces. The authenticator sends an EAPOL-Key frame
         containing an ANonce to the supplicant. The supplicant now has all
         the necessary inputs for the pseudo random function. The supplicant
         derives a PTK from the PMK, ANonce, SNonce, and MAC addresses.
         The supplicant is now in possession of a pairwise transient key that
         can be used to encrypt unicast traffic.
       - M2: The supplicant sends an EAPOL-Key frame containing an SNonce to
         the authenticator. The authenticator now has all the necessary inputs
         for the pseudo random function. The supplicant also sends its RSN
         information element capabilities to the authenticator and a message
         integrity code (MIC). The authenticator derives a PTK from the PMK,
         ANonce, SNonce, and MAC addresses. The authenticator also validates
         the MIC. The authenticator is now in possession of a pairwise
         transient key that can be used to encrypt unicast traffic.
       - M3: If necessary, the authenticator derives a GTK from the GMK.
         The authenticator sends an EAPOL-Key frame to the supplicant
         containing the ANonce, the authenticator’s RSN information element
         capabilities, and an MIC. The EAPOL-Key frame may also contain a
         message to the supplicant to install the temporal keys. Finally,
         the GTK will be delivered inside this unicast EAPOL-Key frame to the
         supplicant. The confidentiality of the GTK is protected because it
         will be encrypted with the PTK.
       - M4: The supplicant sends the final EAPOL-Key frame to the
         authenticator to confirm that the temporal keys have been installed.
